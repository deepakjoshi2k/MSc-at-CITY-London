# 📊 Week 02: Statistical Analysis & Basic Classification

This folder contains MATLAB scripts (`.m` files) covering fundamental statistical measures (Covariance and Correlation) and an introduction to supervised learning using Decision Trees for classification.

---

## 1. Statistical Foundations: Covariance and Correlation

The file `Week02_COV_Corr.m` focuses on exploring relationships between variables using data loaded from the built-in MATLAB `hospital.mat` dataset.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

* **Variance Calculation:** Calculating the variance of a single variable (`hospital.Weight`).
* **Covariance Matrix:** Creating a matrix of selected variables (Weight, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP) and computing the full covariance matrix (`cov(matty)`).
* **Correlation Coefficient:** Calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients between multiple variables (`hospital.Age` and `hospital.BloodPressure`).

### Functions Used
* `load`: Loads standard MATLAB datasets.
* `cov`: Calculates variance (for a single vector) or the covariance matrix.
* `corrcoef`: Calculates the matrix of correlation coefficients.

## 2. Classification Basics: Decision Trees

The file `Week02_t2_DT.m` introduces the core steps of training and testing a Decision Tree classifier using the famous **Iris flower dataset** (`fisheriris.mat`).

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

* **Model Training (`fitctree`):** Training an initial Decision Tree on the entire Iris dataset to visualize the classification logic. The script includes a detailed textual breakdown of the decision rules generated by the tree.
* **Model Visualization:** Using `view(c_tree)` to inspect the structure of the learned tree.
* **Train/Test Split:** Implementing a manual 70/30 split of the data (using `randsample` and logical indexing) for robust model evaluation.
* **Model Evaluation:** Training a model on the training subset and making predictions (`predict`) on the hold-out test subset.
* **Misclassification Error:** Calculating the number of misclassified samples in the test set to assess model performance.

### Functions Used
* `load`: Loads the `fisheriris.mat` dataset.
* `fitctree`: Trains a classification decision tree model.
* `view`: Displays the decision tree structure.
* `rng`: Sets the random number generator seed for reproducibility.
* `randsample`: Used for randomly selecting indices for the training set.
* `predict`: Generates classification predictions from the trained model.
